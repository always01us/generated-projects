 * The SavedSearchRepository is a data-centric service for the {@link SavedSearch} entity.

 * plus some methods to perform searches.
 * <p>
 * Search logic is driven by 2 kinds of parameters: a {@link SavedSearch} instance used
 * as a properties holder against which the search will be performed and a {@link SearchParameters}
 * instance from where you can control your search options including the usage
 * of named queries.
